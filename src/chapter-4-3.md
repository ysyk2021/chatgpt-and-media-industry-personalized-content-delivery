One key advantage of using ChatGPT is the ability to provide real-time interactions with users. Whether through live chatbots or interactive experiences during live broadcasts, ChatGPT enables media companies to engage with their audience in real-time, answering queries, providing recommendations, and facilitating personalized conversations. This fosters a sense of immediacy and connection, enhancing the overall user experience.

Scalability and Efficiency
